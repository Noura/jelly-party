jelly-party
===========
WIP code example for Code 510, a programming after school activity with high school students.

how to use
----------
do the commands

`git clone https://github.com/Noura/jelly-party`

`cd jelly-party`

`npm install`

`node server.js`

open a bunch of tabs in your browser, or have friends do this too, and go to http://[localhost or your local IP]:8000/

everybody is a dot and you can all move around and see each other

TODO
----
I think it would be cuter if everyone were a jellyfish instead of a dot
